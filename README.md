### About Next.js

Next.js is a JavaScript framework created by Zeit. It lets you build server-side rendering and static web applications using React. Itâ€™s a great tool to build your next website. It has many great features and advantages, which can make Nextjs your first option for building your next web application.

### Project Status

This Next.js version contains all the functionalities of it's create react app counterpart. With that being said, there are still some work to do to optimize and refactor code (See <a href="#whats-next">**What's Next**</a> section below).

### Project File Structure

This app contains both create react app and next.js file structures. The app, however, is configured to run next.js and this can be seen in the scripts property of the package.json. I decided to intentionally leave the create react app architecture so components and file structure can be compared while making the migration. The create react app file structure can be found in the `/craSrc` folder.

Some differences between the 2 file structures

- The component views in original `/src/views` are located in the `/pages` folder (I tried to copy the name structure, but Next.js uses the folder name as the route. So I translated the name `nView.jsx` -> `n.js` where `n` is the component name)
- The landing page is located in `/pages/index.js` file.
- The contexts and head tags (this was the head html in the `index.html` file) are located in the file `/pages/_app.js` file. This file is analagous to the `App.js` file rom `create react app` except there are no routes. It also contains an import for the `custom.scss` file (If you want to import global css, you need to import the file here).
- Folder names are routes and folders that have the name `[n]` are routes for params. EX: `/products/[issue_number]` -> `/products/307`
- The styles folder contains the `custom.scss` file.
- The components associated with the views (or pages in this case), wrappers, and shared components are located in `/components`.
- Context files are located in `/contexts`.

### Code Changes

- Replaced `react-router-dom` and it's affiliated code with Next.js's option for routing (Next.js does not use `react-router-dom`).
- Removed conditional render for `<BackLink/>` in `<IndexIssueDetails />` (Spoke with Mateo and was decided to always show `<BackLink />`).
  [This was partly done due to Next.js not able to send state through `history.push` and `history.replace`.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/23991)

### What's Next

- Add Service worker code to Next.js.
- Add Catch all route (Page).
